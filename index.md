# Introduction to Python's Resumes

Welcome to my Introduction to Python's Resumes at Suka Sekolah's Code Class 101.

## Week 1

In this first day we are learning the basic of computing.
Before we start coding, we need to understand some of the computation fundamentals because we'll be able to fully understand coding.

### What a Computer can do ?

We usually use computer for our daily activity like :
- Play Computer Games
- Make a Document
- Edit Photos or Videos
- Browse the Internet
- etc.

> But, Basicly Computer only be able to do 2 things
1. Store Information
2. Perform **Calculations** (Billions of calculations per second)

### What Calculations?
```
By default, the computer can perform calculations that are built-in in the programming language such as
1. Simple Arithmetic Operations
2. Comparation
3. Loop
```

As a programmer we can combine those calculations,
1. Exponent

  We Combine Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, and Division (1) with Loop (3)

2. Array

  We Combine Simple Arithmetic(1), Comparation(2), Loop(3), and Storing Information

### Declarative Knowledge and Imperative/Procuderal Knowledge
